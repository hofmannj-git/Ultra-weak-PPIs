This folder contains all of the analysis scripts, as follows:

'BindingAffinity.ipynb' -- Figures 2, S3D, S4A. Binding affinities K_d as a function of attraction strength V_0/kT. Calculated in simulations for the chosen binding criterion (Fig2), based on the cluster size distribution (FigS3D), and including two more strict binding criteria (FigS4A).

'SecondVirialCoefficient.ipynb' -- upper x-axis in Figures 2 & S4A. Calculates the reduced second virial coefficient B_2* for each studied attraction strength V_0/kT, given the specific form of the interaction potential.

'IndividualDynamics.ipynb' -- Figures 3A & S4B (left). Individual protein dynamics: separation trajectories of example protein pairs (Fig3A, upper), probability distributions of binding and search events (Fig3A, lower), and sensitivity analysis of binding/search event distributions to choice of binding criterion (FigS4B, left).

'BulkDynamics.ipynb' -- Figures 3C, S4B (right), S2C. Bulk protein dynamics: bound likelihood as a function of attraction strength (Fig3C), sensitivity analysis of bound likelihood to choice of binding criterion (FigS4B, right), and mean-squeared displacement of proteins over short times (FigS2C).

'Microstructure.ipynb' -- Figures S3A-C. Coordination number distributions for proteins at three attraction strengths V_0/kT = 0, 2.5, 6; cluster size distributions in the ultra-weak regime from V_0/kT = 0 to 2.5; and probability distributions of cluster dissociation times for systems with attraction strengths V_0/kT = 0 and 2.5.

'EncounterCriterion.ipynb' -- Figures S1. Pair-wise interaction potential between proteins (FigS1A), radial distribution function for the hard sphere case (FigS1B), and average inter-protein bond length for all three attraction strengths.

'MGenitalium.ipynb' -- Figures 4, S5. Ensemble probability distributions of pair-wise electrostatic attraction strengths (Fig4A) and for individual proteins (Fig4B); distribution of charges for cytoplasmic proteins.
